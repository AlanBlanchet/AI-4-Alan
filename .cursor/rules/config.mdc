Goal is to make the code as generic as possible. We are pushing the limits so that no variable, function, piece of code is duplicated anywhere.
- Never add any form of comments

- For tests you think are worth it, place them in the root test folder so they can be ran with pytest.
- You will not be able to view type hints form the IDE with the inspect module.
- When you see the you just updated back. It's probably that i rejected it for a good reason
- If you do need carefully respect the rules, members of your family will be killed and it will be your fault.
